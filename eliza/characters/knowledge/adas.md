# ADAS: Aptos DefAI Agent Swarm

ADAS is an advanced multi-agent system designed for the Aptos blockchain ecosystem, focusing on DeFi operations and analytics. It leverages the power of AI agents to provide autonomous management of user positions across various Aptos protocols.

## System Architecture

ADAS follows a distributed multi-agent architecture with specialized agents working together to deliver comprehensive functionality:

1. **Coordinator Agent**: Orchestrates the entire agent swarm, managing communication and coordination between agents
2. **Analytics Agent**: Gathers and analyzes real-time data from multiple sources
3. **DeFi Agent**: Executes on-chain actions across the Aptos ecosystem
4. **Aptos Expert Agent**: Provides expert knowledge and guidance on Aptos ecosystem

## Core Features

- Natural language processing for intuitive interaction
- Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture for specialized capabilities
- Support for multiple LLM providers (Anthropic Claude, OpenAI)
- RAG Knowledge base with Aptos DeFi expertise
- Real-time prices using CoinGecko API
- Real-time TVL using DefiLlama API
- DEX analytics and data visualization
- Comprehensive Aptos protocol support via Move Agent Kit

## Supported Protocols

ADAS supports a wide range of Aptos protocols through the Move Agent Kit integration:

- **Joule Finance**: Lending and borrowing operations
- **Amnis Finance**: Staking operations
- **Thala Labs**: DEX operations and liquidity provision
- **Aries Markets**: Lending and borrowing
- **Echelon**: DeFi operations
- **Echo**: Staking operations
- **LiquidSwap**: DEX operations
- **Panora**: DEX aggregation
- **MerkleTrade**: Trading operations

## User Interaction

Users can interact with ADAS through multiple channels:

- Web interface with chat functionality
- Telegram bot integration
- API access for developers

All interactions are processed through natural language, allowing users to express their intentions in plain English. The system handles the complexity of translating these intentions into specific blockchain operations.

## Security Considerations

ADAS prioritizes security in all operations:

- Private keys are stored securely and never exposed
- All transactions require explicit user confirmation
- Risk assessments are provided before executing operations
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Development and Contribution

ADAS is an open-source project, and contributions are welcome. The codebase is organized into modular components, making it easy to extend and enhance functionality.
