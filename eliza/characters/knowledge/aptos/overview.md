# Aptos Blockchain Overview

## Introduction

Aptos is a Layer 1 blockchain designed for safety, scalability, and reliability. Developed by former Meta (Facebook) employees who worked on the Diem blockchain project, Aptos launched its mainnet in October 2022. The blockchain is built using the Move programming language and implements a novel consensus mechanism and execution engine to achieve high throughput and low latency.

## Core Features

### BFT Consensus

Aptos uses AptosBFT, a Proof-of-Stake Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus protocol derived from DiemBFT. Key features include:

- Fast finality (typically under 1 second)
- Leader reputation system to optimize validator selection
- Stake-weighted voting
- Validator rotation for security
- Slashing mechanisms for malicious behavior

### Parallel Execution Engine (Block-STM)

One of Aptos's key innovations is its parallel execution engine called Block-STM:

- Executes transactions in parallel rather than sequentially
- Dynamically detects and resolves data conflicts
- Achieves high throughput (up to 160,000 TPS in ideal conditions)
- Maintains low latency even under high load
- Optimizes resource utilization

### Move Programming Language

Aptos uses Move, a safe and expressive programming language:

- Resource-oriented programming model
- First-class assets with ownership semantics
- Strong static typing and formal verification
- Module system for code organization and reuse
- Bytecode verification for safety guarantees

### Account Model

Aptos implements an account-based model with several distinctive features:

- Accounts identified by 32-byte addresses
- Support for resource-oriented storage
- Flexible authentication with account abstraction
- Module publishing under accounts
- Sequence numbers to prevent replay attacks

## Network Architecture

### Validator Nodes

- Run the consensus protocol
- Produce and validate blocks
- Require staking APT tokens
- Currently ~100 active validators
- Ranked by stake amount

### Full Nodes

- Store the complete blockchain state
- Serve API requests
- Can be run by anyone
- Do not participate in consensus
- Support ecosystem applications

### Light Clients

- Verify blockchain data without storing the full state
- Enable resource-constrained devices to interact with the network
- Implement state synchronization protocols

## Tokenomics

### APT Token

- Native utility token of the Aptos blockchain
- Used for transaction fees
- Used for staking to secure the network
- Governance participation
- Initial supply: 1 billion APT
- Inflation: ~7% annually, primarily for staking rewards

### Distribution

- Community: 51.02%
- Core Contributors: 19%
- Foundation: 16.5%
- Investors: 13.48%
- Initial circulating supply was limited with vesting schedules

## Ecosystem

### DeFi Protocols

Aptos has a growing DeFi ecosystem including:

- **Thala**: DEX and stablecoin protocol
- **Joule Finance**: Lending and borrowing platform
- **Amnis Finance**: Liquid staking solution
- **Echelon**: Lending protocol
- **Liquidswap**: AMM DEX
- **Panora**: DEX aggregator
- **Aries Markets**: Lending platform
- **Echo**: Staking protocol

### NFTs and Gaming

- Active NFT marketplace ecosystem
- Gaming projects leveraging Move's asset-oriented design
- Social platforms with NFT integration

### Infrastructure

- Wallets: Petra, Martian, Pontem, Rise
- Indexers and APIs
- Development tools and SDKs
- Oracles: Pyth, Switchboard

## Technical Specifications

### Performance Metrics

- Block time: ~1 second
- Transaction finality: ~1-2 seconds
- Theoretical TPS: Up to 160,000
- Practical TPS: 4,000-10,000 (current mainnet)
- Gas model: Dynamic pricing based on network load

### Network Parameters

- Epoch duration: 2 hours
- Minimum validator stake: 1 million APT
- Maximum validators: Currently capped at 100
- Slashing penalties: For downtime and Byzantine behavior

## Governance

Aptos implements on-chain governance with several key components:

- Governance proposals submitted on-chain
- Voting power proportional to staked APT
- Execution of approved proposals is automatic
- Framework upgrades through governance
- Community forums for discussion

## Development and Tooling

### Development Environment

- Aptos CLI for local development
- Move Package Manager
- Local testnet deployment
- Faucet for testnet tokens

### Testing and Verification

- Move Prover for formal verification

- Simulation environment

### Deployment Tools

- Transaction builder APIs
- SDK support for multiple languages
- Gas estimation tools
- Monitoring and analytics

## Roadmap and Future Development

### Scalability Improvements

- Continued optimization of Block-STM
- Layer 2 solutions exploration
- Sharding research

### Cross-Chain Interoperability

- Bridges to Ethereum and other major blockchains
