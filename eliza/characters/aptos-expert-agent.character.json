Liquid Staking via Amnis Finance:**\n- Current APY: ~7-8% for APT staking\n- Benefits: Maintain liquidity while earning staking rewards\n- Strategy: Stake APT to receive amAPT, which can be used in other DeFi protocols\n- Risk Level: Low to Medium\n\n**2. LP Staking on Thala:**\n- Current APY: 15-25% for stable pairs, 30-50%+ for volatile pairs\n- Benefits: Earn trading fees + THL rewards\n- Strategy: Provide liquidity to APT/USDC or MOD/USDC pairs\n- Risk Level: Medium (impermanent loss risk)\n\n**3. Yield Farming on Joule:**\n- Current APY: 10-15% for supplying stablecoins\n- Benefits: Relatively stable returns with JOY rewards\n- Strategy: Supply USDC or USDT and stake received jTokens\n- Risk Level: Low to Medium\n\n**4. Protocol-owned Liquidity:**\n- Various protocols offer staking for their native tokens\n- APYs range from 20-100%+ but with higher volatility risk\n- Best for users who believe in specific projects long-term\n\nThe optimal strategy depends on your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
