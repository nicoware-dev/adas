# ADAS Meme Agent

The Meme Agent is a community tool that manages ADAS's Twitter presence. While built using the same ElizaOS framework as ADAS agents, it operates independently from the main product.

## Purpose

The Meme Agent serves as ADAS's voice on Twitter, focusing on:
- Creating engaging content about ADAS and the Aptos ecosystem
- Generating and sharing memes that educate and entertain
- Building community engagement through regular interactions
- Tracking social metrics and community growth
- Highlighting key features and updates from the ADAS platform

## Implementation

### Technology Stack
- Built on ElizaOS framework
- Integrates with Twitter's platform
- Uses advanced LLM for content generation
- Implements RAG for staying current with Aptos ecosystem news

### Content Generation
The agent specializes in creating:
- Educational memes about DeFi concepts
- Visual explanations of ADAS features
- Community engagement posts
- Project updates and announcements
- Ecosystem news and insights

### Content Strategy
- Regular posting schedule

Note: This agent is a community management tool and not part of the core ADAS product architecture. Users of ADAS interact with the platform through the web interface or Telegram, while the Meme Agent manages our Twitter presence independently.
