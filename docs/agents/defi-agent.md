## Implementation Details

The DeFi Agent leverages the Aptos plugin to interact with the Aptos blockchain. The plugin provides a comprehensive set of actions that the agent can use to execute various operations.

### Action Flow

1. User sends a request to the DeFi Agent
2. Agent parses the request to identify the intended operation
3. Agent retrieves relevant information (e.g., token prices, gas estimates)
4. Agent presents transaction details to the user for confirmation
5. Upon confirmation, agent executes the transaction
6. Agent monitors transaction status and reports results

### Security Measures

- Private keys are stored securely and never exposed
- All transactions require explicit user confirmation
- Risk assessments are provided before executing operations
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Testing

### Test Prompts

Use these prompts to test the DeFi Agent's capabilities:

#### Core Aptos Actions

```
Transfer 0.001 APT to 0x17a8c3f994621216ad8bac210eb7de3346268696bc14e89e254fd4c7a0c0ed82
Check my APT balance
What's my wallet address?
Get token details for 0x1::aptos_coin::AptosCoin
What's the current price of APT?
```

#### Token Management

```
Create a new token named "MyToken" with symbol "MTK"
Mint 1000 tokens
Burn 500 of my tokens
```

#### NFT Operations

```
Create an NFT called "My First NFT" in collection "My Collection"
Transfer my NFT to 0x123456789abcdef
```

#### Joule Finance

```
Deposit 5 APT on Joule
Borrow 10 USDC from Joule
Repay my USDC loan on Joule
Withdraw 2 APT from Joule
```

#### Amnis Finance

```
Stake 2 APT on Amnis
Unstake 1 APT from Amnis
Check my staking rewards on Amnis
```

#### Liquidswap
