## Implementation Details

The Aptos Expert Agent uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to provide accurate and up-to-date information:

1. User query is analyzed to identify the information need
2. Relevant documents are retrieved from the knowledge base
3. Retrieved information is synthesized with the agent's reasoning capabilities
4. A comprehensive, accurate response is generated

### Knowledge Management

The knowledge base is organized into:
- Core knowledge shared across all agents
- Protocol-specific knowledge
- Strategy-focused knowledge
- Agent-specific knowledge
